    more-about_html: "<strong>An illustrators’ collective sharing their perspectives of Bordeaux</strong>
    <br><br>
    Dame Jeanne is a cultural association, bringing artists together around the common theme of « Bordeaux and its surroundings ». It is composed of 11 members - illustrators, graphic designers, painters and photographers - who love their city.
    <br>
    The members of the collective, who come from all over France, each convey their own unique point of view and personal style. As a result, the collective is able to offer a wide variety of graphic works reflecting Bordeaux and its surroundings.
    <br>
    The association takes its name from the dame Jeanne (Lady Joan), a big bottle used in the past to transport and store liquids such as wine, a hint to one of Bordeaux’s most famous cultural aspect.
    Here, this lovely bottle allows us to maintain and to share the illustrated heritage of Bordeaux.
    <br><br><br>
    <strong>The activities of the bottle</strong>
    <br><br>
    Dame Jeanne wishes to publish 2 collections of posters and postcards per year, each collection being composed of 33 different illustrations (each of the 11 funding members creates 3 illustrations).
    <br><br>
    The posters are first introduced during an launch event, followed by an exhibition, before being submitted to various sellers, galleries, local stores, pop-up and e-shops."
